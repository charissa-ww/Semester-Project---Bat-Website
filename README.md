# Semester-Project---Bat-Website
A Spring 2024 semester project for both my Environmental Science and Interface Design Classes

My project for Environmental Science is to create a presentation about a climate change issue through any format. I decided to combine this project with the one for my Interface Design class, which was to create a full website about a topic of our choosing, to make this website. It discusses the effects of climate change on bats, along with some possible solutions and actions that you can take to help.

I worked together with a partner to create the content for the website, but all of the coding and design is my own. This is written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without using any frameworks. I used Font Awesome for the icons and Unsplash for all of the images, which are credited on the site.
